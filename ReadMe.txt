1. Java Lambda Expressions
   >> Lambda expression is a new and important feature of Java which was included in Java SE 8.
   >> It is very useful in collection library.
   >> It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.
   >> Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
   >> Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.

2. Java Method References
   >> Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8.
   >> Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface.
   >> It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.

   >> There are following types of method references in java:
